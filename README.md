How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
----I ensure that my code is functional and secure by running sufficient tests to cover all bases. Using the software requirement document I then ensure that all requirements have been met.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-----I use the software requirement documents to interpret the user needs. If I am working on a team and we have a question then I would reach out to the scrum master who can then pass the questions on to the Product Owner. I find that a direct approach is the best way to approach any questions when working on a project.

How do I approach designing software?
---I approach designing software from a relative headspace. I try to look at the design document and the system requirements documents and formulate a plan. Then I begin coding for one step at a time. I begin with the easiest to implement functions and then I build from there.
